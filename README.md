Our project basically practices in the field of Deepfake technology. Our mobile-based application contains information and hands-on experience of its most recent developments.

In today's modern world of rapidly growing technology, it is important that technologies like DeepFake are spread to the general public in each and every stage of its development so that the threat that these technologies possess can be diluted over time.

We aim to do just that. We plan to spread awareness about latest developments in Deepfake technology by implementing them into android applications, that are open to everyone.

We ran into a lot of challenges before completing this project.
We faced several issues regarding the compatibility of the different platforms of python based machine learning scripts and android applications.

We also ran into many other issues regarding our algorithms that we were using as an intermediate. This experience of finding these bugs, small and big is what made this experience worthwhile.
